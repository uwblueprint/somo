== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Local database setup:
The database is set up to use the default user postgres. This is more of a development environment setup issue than in-app changes. Developers need to have postgres installed, create a user, and then create the db before the first rake.


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
